# Modeling the Spread of Opioid Crisis

## Introduction

This is the repository for my MCM team 1902800 (team #). This modeling project processed the raw data of opioid spread in the United States, analyzed the potential factors affecting the opioid use, and advised potential solutions in controlling the spread with the results from our mathematical model. We standardized the raw data and used hierarchical clustering method to cluster these opioids from their severities and influences. We also implemented traditional SIR model and gravity model to track the changes and spread of opioid use and later on used linear polynomial regression to analyze the impacts and derivatives of various impacting factors.
